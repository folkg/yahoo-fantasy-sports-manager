# Yahoo Fantasy Sports Manager
A program to automatically set optimal Yahoo fantasy lineups each day to make team management more hands-off. This uses the "percent started" attribute from the Yahoo system to make the lineup decisions. This essentially crowd-sources the lineup decisions to other fantasy players.

This program has only been tested with Hockey and Football as these are the only two fantasy sports that I participate in. There may be quirks or optimizations for other sports that have not been considered.

This was written in Google App Script for two reasons. Firstly, to learn a bit about the Google Cloud platform and Google App Script. Secondly, the scripts can be easily scheduled to run automatically without having to host it on my own server.
